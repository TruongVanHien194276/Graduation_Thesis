**Topic:**
Predicting fetal genetic diseases based on medical record 

**Description:** 

The main goal is to build a model to predict fetal genetic diseases based on parameters in screening and ultrasound results. Specifically, the project will:
1. Analyze medical records database from more than 3000 Vietnamese pregnant women.
2. Analyze and preprocess medical data to prepare for the model training process.
3. Evaluate the results of deployed models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
4. Proposing a new suitable model (FT-Transformer...) to predict fetal genetic diseases based on parameters in medical records.
5. Evaluate the performance of the prediction model and determine accuracy.

**Model:**
1. Logistic Regression
2. XGBoost
3. LightGBM
4. Feature Tokenizer - Transformer
